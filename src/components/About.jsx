        <h2>Welcome to my webpaige ðŸ‘‹</h2>
        <br/>
        <h2>
          I'm currently a senior at Simmons University studying Computer Science and 
          minoring in Biology & Biostatistics. In 2021 I took my first ever programming class in Java, 
          and fell in love with how fun it can be to wrestle over difficult problems with a team. Since then,
          I've pursued internships and personal projects in mainly web and mobile development.
        </h2>
          <br/>
          <h2>Outside of coding, I'm passionate about epidemiology and virology. The spread of disease and how to prevent it has 
            interested me since I was a little kid. Throughout the pandemic I worked in a medical laboratory which gave me 
            exposure to what finding illnesses on the cellular level looks like. Helping patients' lives gave me a strong sense of
            fulfillment and I would love to create software that enhances people's lives as well - in or outside of the medical field.
