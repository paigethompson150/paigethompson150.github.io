          Hi, I'm Paige! I'm a graduate of Simmons University with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. In 2021 I took my first ever programming class in Java, 
          and fell in love with how fun it can be to tackle difficult problems on a team. I'm currently working as an Associate Mobile Engineer at Fidelity Investments!
